# Aristotle proof-search ledger

Aristotle results are proof candidates. Primary owns submissions, monitoring,
downloads, integration, and local Lean 4.34 verification. Luna owns the assigned
implementation files. Keep generated requests/results outside the checkout.

## Strict-chain elementary identity

- Project ID: `262ce79f-3c8a-4e6a-83f7-6fcf6a6c9eb6`.
- Submitted 2026-09-25 through the installed `aristotle` CLI.
- Request directory:
  `/lake-cache/ai-projects/requests/VerticalStripLLT/strict-chain-esymm`.
- Exact target: for every `n m : ℕ`, the sum of `∏ i, x_(c i)` over strictly
  increasing functions `c : Fin n → Fin m` is
  `MvPolynomial.esymm (Fin m) (Polynomial ℤ) n`.
- All boundary cases are included. No LLT recurrence or expansion is assumed.
- Intended use: combine with the independently proved graph/coloring
  characterization of `n d^k e` to establish the manuscript's general base case.
- Suggested proof: finite subsets of cardinality `n` correspond to increasing
  enumerations via `Finset.orderEmbOfFin`.
- Environment warning: service reports Lean 4.28.0; local target is Lean 4.34.0,
  Mathlib `5ed2965256430c3649e86755f9576b54eca72435`. Port and verify locally.
- Task ID: `1ffc730d-dfb2-4d27-9d61-b0f0cc851e0f`; SDK query confirmed
  `IN_PROGRESS`. No proof integrated yet.

## Prepared concatenation request

- Request directory:
  `/lake-cache/ai-projects/requests/VerticalStripLLT/path-concat`.
- Contains the existing path model and six append/translation laws for path
  validity and the two edge scanners. No manuscript files or credentials.
- Submission was rejected because the service permits no additional project
  while the first task is running. There is no accepted second project ID.
- Do not resubmit until capacity is available and local task ownership has been
  reconciled; Luna may implement these elementary structural inductions locally.

The API credential is loaded by the shared environment helper and is never
passed on the command line or stored in this repository. Do not upload the
workspace or reference snapshot wholesale; requests contain only needed inputs.
