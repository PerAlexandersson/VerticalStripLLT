# Redistributing one component through an NN move

2026-09-28. We follow the author's proposed argument: split one component
using the diagram recurrence, apply further diamonds, and collect complete
components in smaller diagrams. We do not require it to be isolated inside
an auxiliary union of source components. The example and local transport
below are proved; the uniform reconstruction for arbitrary components
remains to be found.

The [overlap analysis](COMPONENT_NN_OVERLAPS.md) proves that this initial
image already has constant coefficients across every flip preserving ab.
Only two overlapping-triangle geometries need further redistribution.

The [four-edge case table](COMPONENT_FOUR_EDGE_CASES.md) gives a shorter
repair of the canonical image for the five-state example below: one
redundant-edge equality completes two target components simultaneously.

Write [T] for either the strict-coloring enumerator K(T) or the HRV elementary
expression E(T). All sums are unweighted. These state valuations depend on
the full selected relation, not on which selected edges are marked strict.
Every equality below uses the same coefficients for the two valuations.

## A complete example using three diamonds

Take area (0,1,2,3), with strict corner 03. For readability put

    a=01, b=02, c=12, d=13, e=23, f=03.

Here the letters denote edges, and juxtaposition denotes a selected set.
The five orientations

    C = {fabc, fabd, fbcd, fbde, fcde}

form a complete component. Delete corner f. The smaller diagram has area
(0,1,2,2), with all its edges normal. Its following four sets are complete
components:

    D1 = {abd, bcd, bde},       D2 = {abcd, abde, bcde},
    D3 = {be},                 D4 = {abe, bce}.

We prove

    X(C) = X(D1) + X(D2) + X(D3) − X(D4),    X=K,E.       (1)

First apply the source diamond with retained edge f and exchanged shorts
a,d:

    [fabc]+[fbcd] = [fbc]+[fabcd] = [bcd]+[abcd].

The last equality swaps vertices 0,1 in the first term and removes redundant
f in the second. The other three orientations give

    [fabd]=[abd],       [fbde]=[bde],
    [fcde]=[fce]=[bde].

For the last equality we first remove d, which is redundant through c,e,
and then swap vertices 0,1. These swaps preserve both valuations: they
relabel the entire selected relation, and both swapped vertices are
nonsinks, so the labeled reachable sinks and HRV fiber sizes are preserved.
We have now obtained

    X(C) = X(D1) + [abcd] + [bde].

The last two terms are incomplete pieces. We redistribute them using two
diamonds in the smaller diagram, both retaining b and exchanging a,c:

    [abde]+[bcde] = [bde]+[abcde],
    [abe]+[bce]   = [be]+[abce].

Since d is redundant through c,e, we have [abcde]=[abce]. Subtracting the
second diamond from the first gives

    [bde] = [abde]+[bcde]+[be]−[abe]−[bce].

Substitution proves (1), with all resulting terms grouped into the displayed
complete components. Thus the extra diamond moves do exactly the required
reassembly. This example uses no component-expansion theorem as an input.

## The initial NN split for any one component

Return to vertex labels a<b=a+1<c, with strict corner ac, and retain all
eligible ordinary NN hypotheses. Put q=ab and r=bc. Let Q be the common
exterior selection and let σ interchange a,b. Use L_ij(Q) for the four
source states with bits q,r, and let h_ij(Q) indicate membership in the
single component C under consideration.

Let D0=L-ac be the corner-deletion diagram. Its natural graph is that of
the shortened NN target R, but r remains normal in D0 and is strict in R.
Write D0_ij(Q) for its states. The selected-r sector is exactly the union
of complete components identified with R. This permits us to do the entire
redistribution in D0 and split off the R components afterwards if desired.

Put δ=h_10−h_01. If ac covers in L_10, then L_10↔L_01 is an actual flip.
Indeed, ab is adjacent; an alternate b-to-c path would contradict the
coverhood of ac after ab is included; and adding bc after removing ab
cannot make ac redundant, since no a-to-b path remains. Component membership
therefore gives δ=0. Consequently, whenever δ is nonzero, ac is redundant
in L_10 and can be deleted from that state without changing either valuation.

The source diamond and the ordinary NN endpoint identifications now give

    X_L(C) = Σ_Q (h_00(Q)+h_01(Q)) [D0_01(σQ)]
             + Σ_Q (h_11(Q)+h_01(Q)) [D0_11(Q)]
             + Σ_Q (h_10(Q)−h_01(Q)) [D0_10(Q)].        (2)

This is an exact split of the original component into smaller-diagram
orientations, for both K and E. In particular, it retains the unmatched
middle orientations instead of enlarging C to force a pairing. What remains
is to redistribute the right side into whole components, as in the example.

The further source identity [L_01(Q)]=[L_01(σQ)] can also be used in that
redistribution. Both ac and bc are selected, so σ conjugates the entire
selected relation and fixes every sink label. Marking ac rather than bc
strict is irrelevant to this unweighted equality. We do not assert equality
of decorated diagrams or preservation of source component membership.

## The two remaining coefficient comparisons

We keep the indicator h of the single component C throughout. The initial
image (2) has coefficients

    w₀₀=0,                    w₁₀=h₁₀−h₀₁,
    w₀₁=(h₀₀+h₀₁)∘σ,         w₁₁=h₁₁+h₀₁.

These are already constant across every target flip preserving q, by
[the overlap lemma](COMPONENT_NN_OVERLAPS.md). Since r is maximal in D0,
no target flip exchanges r. Thus only the following two geometries remain:

| Target overlap | P | Q | Retained edge | Exchanged edges |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Left, t<a<b<c | T+tb | T+ta+tb | tb | ta, q |
| Right, a<b<d<c | T+ad | T+ad+bd | ad | bd, q |

Here T includes the other strict edges, and the displayed target flip is
assumed actual. For either row and j=0,1, put

    Uⱼ=D0_0j(Q),       Vⱼ=D0_1j(P),
    Δⱼ=w(Vⱼ)−w(Uⱼ),   H=h₀₀+h₀₁.

Adding the maximal source corner lifts the target flip, giving
h₁₀(P)=h₀₀(Q) and h₁₁(P)=h₀₁(Q). Substitution gives the SAME bookkeeping
for both overlap types:

    Δ₀=h₁₀(P)−h₀₁(P),
    Δ₁=h₀₁(Q)+h₀₁(P)−H(σQ),
    Δ₀+Δ₁=H(Q)−H(σQ).                              (3)

Thus the remaining work is to repair these coefficients and collect whole
target components. A repair must have zero valuation for both K and E;
diamonds, redundant-edge equalities and the allowed adjacent relabelings
supply such identities. Once the repaired coefficients agree across every
target flip, choose one representative of each complete target component
D. Its common coefficient m_D gives

    X(C)=Σ_D m_D X(D),       X=K,E.

This is the desired component recurrence, in the smaller diagram D0.
It does not require proving that C is isolated in a larger source packet.
After a local repair, agreement across other incident flips must still
be checked; the initial q-preserving constancy cannot simply be assumed
to survive arbitrary changes of coefficients.

The recent unicyclic arguments are available precisely where (3) compares
source memberships. The [middle-join theorem](COMPONENT_NN_MIDDLE_JOINS.md)
and [inactive corrections](COMPONENT_NN_INACTIVE_CORRECTIONS.md) control
the middle term. The [incoming-bridge repair](COMPONENT_NN_FIRST_JOINS.md)
and new [sink swap](COMPONENT_NN_SINK_REPAIR.md) identify further first-join
pieces. These are supporting repairs, with their stated hypotheses; a
uniform repair of (3) for every component is still missing. The five-state
calculation above and its [sixteen-case table](COMPONENT_FOUR_EDGE_CASES.md)
show the complete push, repair and collection in a proved example.

The [tree-sector calculation](COMPONENT_NN_TREE_SECTORS.md) now proves a
uniform recurrence for the connected source tree component: its image is
exactly a union of complete smaller forest components, each with coefficient
one. For an arbitrary source component, every connected target tree component
selecting r already has a constant coefficient in this initial split.

For a connected unicyclic source component, the
[simultaneous inactive-corner repair](COMPONENT_NN_UNICYCLIC_REASSEMBLY.md)
completes every r-absent piece and preserves all q-preserving equalities.
The selected-r tree and disconnected sectors are already whole; target
components inactive at r are now proved whole too. Only connected target
unicyclic components active at r can still require repair. This does not
settle the remaining first mixed comparisons or higher cycle ranks.

## What Rust has checked

We reused the existing Rust cover-flip model, the maintained exact sparse
linear algebra in `sym-poly-core`, strict P-partition enumerators in
`sym-poly-qsym`, and HRV maps in `sym-poly-sym`. No new polynomial generator
or replacement graph enumerator was introduced.

The first calculation allowed the distinguished NN diamond, the preceding
source swap, and deletion of redundant ac. It found integral expressions in
complete D0 components for all 3 components of area (0,1,2), all 15 components
of area (0,1,2,3), all 18 components of area (0,1,2,3,2) at corner 03,
and three selected components of the six-vertex diagram below. The example
(1) is a short hand proof extracted from one of these exact certificates.

In area (0,1,2,3,4,3), with strict corners 04,25 and NN corner 25, four
further tested components required additional redistribution. Starting with
(2), we allowed actual diamonds in D0, equality of transitive closures, and
adjacent relabelings that remain in D0 and preserve the order of sinks.
All four then admitted expressions in complete D0 components. Ordering the
component columns differently in the exact linear solve gives the following
shorter, positive integer expressions, improving the first rational answers.
Here C_m and D_m denote the complete components containing full-edge mask m
in the source and deletion diagrams, respectively:

| Source component | Expression in smaller components, for both K and E |
| --- | --- |
| C_767 | D_1151 + D_1279 + D_1499 + 2D_2303 + 5D_2751 + 4D_3709 |
| C_1979 | D_1471 |
| C_1023 | D_1279 + D_1535 + 2D_3711 |
| C_2043 | D_1535 |

The deletion diagram has area (0,1,2,3,4,2) and strict corner 04. Masks
use the sorted full natural-edge list of the respective diagram, including
strict edges; they are not normal-edge masks. These are exact finite
certificates from the permitted relations. We have not yet extracted short
hand proofs of the table or a uniform redistribution rule.

For every successful expression we independently evaluated the same
coefficients on both sides: strict P-partition generating functions agreed
exactly in the fundamental basis, and HRV expressions agreed exactly in the
elementary basis. Thus these checks cover every alphabet, not just a small
numerical specialization. The relation calculations also independently
certify the expressions from the permitted local identities.

There are 177 source components and 362 deletion-diagram components in that
six-vertex example. The initial calculation tested seven source components;
the complete `--six-all` run now tests all 177. Exactly 173 admit the first
local construction; the other four are precisely those in the displayed
table (indices 31,47,38,50). The expanded relations suffice for all four.
All 177 resulting expressions have integer coefficients, with independent
exact K and E checks. This is exhaustive for this diagram, not for arbitrary
diagrams or degrees. The new receipt is `nn-all-components/six-all.jsonl`
under the external request cache. The earlier restriction to target
diamonds alone was insufficient for the chosen initial split; this is not
an obstruction to the author's proposed argument.

External source:

    diamond-exploration/hrv-bridge/src/bin/nn_component_transport.rs

under `/lake-cache/ai-projects/requests/VerticalStripLLT/`. The receipt
`recurrence-continuation/nn_rust_transport_certificates.jsonl` retains the
first coefficients; its `.log` records the five-state example and the
allowed relation counts. The improved table is in
`nn-overlap/nn_rust_small_certificates.jsonl`. Each receipt directory has
source and receipt hashes. The earlier source is preserved as
`recurrence-continuation/nn_component_transport-at-c83dffb.rs`; the source
used for the improved table is copied into `nn-overlap/`. Each Rust run
used a 600-second cap and reduced priority.
No shared Rust source, Lean source, or manuscript file was changed.

Astra derived and audited the direct split, the local redistribution
equations, and the three-diamond example. Luna independently checked (2),
with the unweighted marking convention made explicit. Primary checked the
proofs, reused the Rust APIs, and verified the exact expressions.
