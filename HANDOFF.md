# VerticalStripLLT handoff

## Current first-join tree comparisons

2026-09-28, from pushed `77913ae`. The requested combinatorial recurrence
proof remains active. **Required scope: ordinary components only.** The
user considers the circular extension optional; locality is not a proof
of that extension. The existing separate Lean theorem remains intact.

New [first NN joins](docs/proofs/COMPONENT_NN_FIRST_JOINS.md): a tree
path with fixed exterior lifts whenever the exterior meets the local
vertices at at most two attachments with no directed path between them.
This lemma allows arbitrary exterior cycle rank. For connected unicyclic
first left joins whose cycle avoids a,b, the least selected incoming
tail makes the two attached trees have the same envelope. More generally,
adjoin a covering cycle edge incident to the attachment root: the
remaining cycle path has no directed connection between the two ends.
Equal envelopes of these enlarged trees then prove the first join.
The same criterion repairs an incoming bridge away from the cycle.

The n10 nonleast-tail first join and n9 remote-cycle bridge examples
both satisfy this enlarged-tree criterion. Their original attached-tree
envelopes differ; after adjoining the strict cycle corner they agree.
The known inactive example fails precisely because the exterior has a
directed path across that corner. Survival alone has not been proved
to provide a suitable covering edge incident to the attachment root.

The preceding [middle-join theorem](docs/proofs/COMPONENT_NN_MIDDLE_JOINS.md)
settles all middle joins in cycle rank one. General first joins, DN/DD,
recurrence coverage and higher cycle ranks remain. Do not claim the full
ordinary component recurrence proof from these partial results.

Verification: exact local searches produced paths of 11 and 10 actual
flips in the n10 and n9 examples. All 12,109 and 1,665 traversed local
flip tests agree with the original full diagrams. Correct envelope
maxima and the inactive failure were checked explicitly. Final Cargo
command exits0. These finite checks support the general arguments.
Primary and the existing Astra reviewer independently audited the
criteria and the final written note. The written audit passed without
further corrections, including both corrected fixture maxima.

Primary owns the new note/index/handoff/archive and external consumers,
and retains the sole serialized Lean build slot. Existing Astra
simpler_component_route completed the bounded read-only, build-free
written-note audit and released ownership. No new worker/account, Claude process, Lean build,
maintained Rust edit or manuscript edit. Compiler jobs are terminal.

Frozen sources, exact command, receipts and hashes:
`/lake-cache/ai-projects/requests/VerticalStripLLT/first-join-tree-lifts/`.
Maintained Rust HEAD remains d53fb193af3c69adedbd9ec8592f87235d809ffa.
No polynomial generator was introduced. Existing flip-API integration
and Lean-MCP routing suggestions remain applicable. Earlier owned Claude
consultations are terminal; no Claude result is used here.

[Archived preceding checkpoints](docs/archive/component-recurrence-handoff-through-path-square-20260928.md)
retain general middle joins, left/right transitions, inactive corrections,
leftmost NN and path-square results with exact verification boundaries.

## Earlier recurrence research

[Recent checkpoints](docs/archive/component-recurrence-handoff-through-four-cycle-20260928.md)
retain the right four-cycle, unicyclic classification and global-reassembly
proofs and receipts. [Earlier checkpoints](docs/archive/component-recurrence-handoff-through-redundancy-20260928.md)
retain the NN/DN/DD packet proofs, exact failures of stronger isolation
claims, direct local reconstructions, and redundancy-diamond results.
The latest preceding checkpoint is `77913ae`, pushed to `origin/main`.
The current proof notes are indexed by [docs/README.md](docs/README.md).

## Current manuscript

2026-09-28: completed the user's new separate circular-first draft in Overleaf:
`/home/paxinum/Dropbox/Apps/Overleaf/LLT flip/dyck-first.tex` and
`dyck-first.pdf` (12 pages, nine diagrams). The aggregate circular HRV proof
comes first, by unicellular/bounce relations and half-square-area/strict-rank
induction, including the column reversal. Ordinary components follow, with
word algebra in an appendix. The previous main/sections and all original
archives are preserved. See [manuscript synchronization](docs/MANUSCRIPT.md).

A follow-up restores the ordinary diamond lemma in Section 4.2 with an inline
four-state diagram. The valid local identities are distinguished from the
obstructed fixed-diagram chain-straightening proposal; the word argument supplies
the global component step. The updated 12-page preview builds without warnings
and the new page was visually inspected. No Lean change or build was needed.

Primary owns the new draft and metadata. Astra reviewed the circular argument;
Luna reviewed the ordinary argument and its historical route. Corrections and
notation clarifications are incorporated; assignments are released. The old
component recurrence outline was never the completed proof. The new ordinary
section follows the checked word/Cauchy/signed-sink approach.
`DYCK-FIRST-MAP.md` in Overleaf gives exact source correspondence and review
boundaries. Clean external LaTeX build, resolved references and visual checks.
No Lean source or build changed; no account, worktree or supervisor worker changed.

## Completed result

The requested **full circular component proof is formalized**, together with the
ordinary component theorem, common shifted q-weight, elementary positivity,
and weighted degree. No component proof obligation remains.

Public declarations in namespace `VerticalStripLLT.Circular`:

- `component_strict_eq_elementary_of_forward`
- `component_strict_eq_elementary`
- `component_weighted_strict_eq_orientation_sum`
- `component_weighted_strict_eq_eval`
- `component_weighted_e_positive`

See [the completion audit](docs/COMPONENT_COMPLETION.md) for exact statements,
source correspondence and proof modules. The ordinary theorem is in
`Components/OrdinaryComponentExpansion.lean`; the circular result is in
`Components/ComponentExpansion.lean`. Both are main-library imports.

They use the actual complete global flip component, strict-coloring sum and
HRV elementary expression. No balance, connectivity, saturation or recurrence
hypothesis remains. All finite alphabets, including m=0, are covered. Circular
`Diagram n` requires n>0; an empty-vertex component is not represented here.
The formal statement is finite strict/e, corresponding to the manuscript's
weak/h convention; a finite-alphabet omega translation is not claimed.
The original ordinary and aggregate circular LLT theorems remain complete.

## Verification

Current full library: **2074 jobs**. Current axiom inventory: **2803 entries**, only
`propext`, `Classical.choice` and `Quot.sound`. No placeholders, custom axioms
or unchecked native proofs. Source guards, edited modules' 100-column checks,
public-header preservation and `git diff --check` pass. Existing linter/deprecation warnings remain.
Pinned Lean 4.34.0 / Mathlib `5ed2965256430c3649e86755f9576b54eca72435`.

Current streamlining logs: `streamlining-audit/library-build.log` and
`streamlining-audit/axioms.log` under the project request cache. Original completion
logs under `/lake-cache/ai-projects/requests/VerticalStripLLT/circular-continuation/`:

- `hrv-scan-extraction-build.log`: Claude candidate, first local build passes.
- `component-positive-build.log`: Luna positivity candidate passes.
- `component-expansion-build.log`: ordinary and circular assembly, 1776 jobs.
- `component-completion-library-build.log`: full library, 2074 jobs.
- `component-completion-axioms.log`: 2800 entries, standard axioms only.

Independent Astra audit found no semantic defect in the final extraction,
ordinary assembly, circular transport or public weighted/positivity statements.

## Ownership and workflow

Academic restart retained `/workspace/lean/VerticalStripLLT`, branch `main`.
Primary owns all integrated source, docs and the sole serialized Lean build slot.
No auxiliary build or implementation process remains active. All Astra/Luna
assignments are released. The explicitly authorized nested Claude consultant
completed normally. The implementation consultant edited only
`Components/HRVScanExtraction.lean`; the later streamlining consultant was
read-only. Primary locally verified all integrated candidates.
No new account, worktree or supervisor worker was started.

Before any future build, inspect Lean/Lake processes across all projects.
Use `lake-workspace`, never plain Lake. All artifacts remain under `/lake-cache`.
Runtime Lean MCP is rooted in RealRooted; the recorded fallback is source search
and serialized wrapper builds (`suggestions/project-tool-routing.md`). Runtime
registry and `codex mcp list` were inspected during this continuation.

Routine pushes use existing gh credentials without changing remote configuration:

```sh
git -c url.https://github.com/.insteadOf=git@github.com: \
  -c credential.helper='!gh auth git-credential' push origin main
```

## Checkpoints and recovery

Implementation checkpoint **`f355a28`** completes the component proof and adds
HRVScanExtraction, ComponentPositive, OrdinaryComponentExpansion and
ComponentExpansion. Preceding pushed checkpoints:

- `8af13f9`: actual component scan semantics and cancellation, 2070/2784.
- `d0244d7`: complete conditional circular-to-ordinary reduction, 2060/2743.
- `33cdecc`: whole-component undecoration and normalized lifts, 2041/2627.
- `0eac2b2`: coefficient constancy, 2033/2590.
- `d4af8ce`: tight flip reconstruction, 2029/2578.
- `6bf5f42`: actual finite companion, 2017/2529.

Detailed earlier progress is archived in
[the balanced-reduction handoff](docs/archive/component-foundation-through-balanced-reduction-20260927.md)
and [the scan handoff](docs/archive/component-scan-handoff-20260927.md).
The accepted shorter route needs only forward flip transport: the compatible
ordinary preimage is a union of complete components. Direct HRV threshold
induction replaces a global ordered-partition bijection.
No further Lean proof work is queued. Cumulant formalization and a general
symmetric-functions library remain outside the completed formalization task.
The subsequent user-authorized manuscript rewrite is recorded above.

## Post-completion cleanup

User requested conservative proof golf, notes consolidation, a short presentable
README and a challenge file. Primary owns all source and the sole build slot;
Luna's bounded MountainScan assignment is returned and released.

- MountainScan: function extensionality replaces recursive congruence; scalar
  linearity uses direct finite-sum simplification. 110 to 94 lines.
- HRVScanExtraction: shorter cutoff and conditional cases, direct full-cutoff
  specialization, current if/Fin lemma names. 259 to 234 lines.
- All public theorem headers and hypotheses are unchanged. These two modules
  compile without warnings; no runtime speedup is claimed from shorter source.
- README: 129 to 43 lines. docs/README: 128 to 29 lines; the detailed catalogue
  is retained in docs/RESEARCH_NOTES.md. Earlier research notes now carry explicit
  historical labels, and stale completion claims in the source audit and ledger
  are corrected without promoting unused auxiliary claims to theorems.
- Challenge.lean states faithful ordinary/circular targets using semantic imports
  only. CHALLENGE.md gives constraints, smaller targets and checking instructions.
  It is a project-based challenge, not a self-contained Mathlib-only export.
- Independent Astra review found no issue with the proof edits or challenge.

Cleanup full build: 2074 jobs; inventory: 2800 entries, only the standard axioms.
Logs: `/lake-cache/ai-projects/requests/VerticalStripLLT/post-completion-cleanup/`.
Challenge.lean compiles, and the separate ChallengeReference.lean check confirms
both challenge propositions match the proved theorems (standard axioms only).
Source widths, unchanged public headers, relative documentation links and
`git diff --check` pass. Baseline: 23d4df7; proof checkpoint: f355a28.
Proof-cleanup checkpoint: `7e9e31b`. The accompanying documentation checkpoint
adds Challenge.lean/CHALLENGE.md, the short README and the organized research
catalogue. All cleanup assignments are released; no owned process remains active.

## Second streamlining pass: complete

User requested further proof golf, useful shared lemmas and a Claude audit.
Verified implementation checkpoint: **`0b64954`**, on `main`, based on `a8fdacd`.
Primary owned all 13 edited component modules,
Verification.lean and accompanying documentation. No account, worktree or
supervisor worker changed. All implementation and review assignments are released.

The read-only Claude audit completed normally (20-minute monitored cap,
Read/Glob/Grep only, no compiler or write access). Primary implemented its five
recommendations plus circular grouping simplifications. Independent Astra review
found no semantic or public-signature regression. See
[the streamlining audit](docs/PROOF_STREAMLINING.md) for decisions and reusable
helpers. Source length falls from 1845 to 1731 lines across 13 modules; every
existing public header is preserved. The helpers have two, two and six uses.

All edited modules passed focused builds, followed by the full 2074-job build
and 2803-entry axiom inventory (standard axioms only). The tail wrapper requires
an explicit expanded carrier-predicate hypothesis to simplify both conditionals;
the cancellation rewrite requires an explicit summand. Source guards, 100-column
checks, documentation links and diff checks pass. No runtime speedup is claimed.

Logs: `/lake-cache/ai-projects/requests/VerticalStripLLT/streamlining-audit/`:
`claude-audit-result.md`, `component-grouping-build.log`,
`claude-recommendations-build-5.log`, `library-build.log`, `axioms.log`.
Builds were serialized around the other project's work. All owned compiler,
consultant and wait processes finished. No further cleanup is queued.
